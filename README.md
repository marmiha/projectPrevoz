# projectPrevoz
Simple *.html creator for www.prevoz.org, which lists all possible rides on specified route and day, with all their offered info. 

Created for the sole purpose of not needing to click on each of the available rides, to find one that suits you the most. Simple "Ctrl+F" solves the job.
### Requirements
- BaseX installation (http://basex.org/download/) for XQuery

### TODO
